## The project is not complete

for last 8 months I have been working on other projects where db was not related.

So I forgot those syntax. During this two whole hour. I googled those params, read docs, fixed bug and Finally
only exposed 3 endpoint two to add to the respective databaes and 1 for filter query.

So i did not had enough to go to the next part for `cron job`.

Though what I did tried to make following the best practices.

## The api docs

The api doc will be found in fastapi documentation
after starting the project via

```bash
uv run fastapi dev
```

open

```bash
localhost:8000/docs
```

And all is there.
